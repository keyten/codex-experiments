# Game Demo

A minimal Three.js third-person sword fighting demo based on the
`webgl_animation_multiple` example.

The character model is loaded from `https://example.com/models/SwordMan.glb`.
Replace this URL in `main.js` with a GLB model containing running, strike,
block and dodge animations.

Controls:

* **WASD** – Move/rotate the character
* **J** – Strike
* **K** – Block
* **L** – Dodge

Run a local web server in this folder to play:

```bash
npx http-server
```
